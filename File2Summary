Clustering records with 3 clusters.
sum squared error: 1.314204

Clustering records with 2 clusters.
sum squared error: 10.662558

Clustering records with 4 clusters.
sum squared error: 1.184606

Because clustering with 4 clusters brings in minimal improvements in the sum
squared error compared to clustering with 3 clusters, I will say that there should be
3 clusters.
In addition, I did a pairwise graph to show the clusters (with different colors).
It is obvious from the graph that there should be 3 clusters.
